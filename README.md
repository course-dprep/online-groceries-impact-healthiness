# The Impact of Online Grocery Shopping (OGS) on the Healthiness of Householdsâ€™ Food Purchases

*Note: the final product of this project ("final_product.pdf") can be found in the gen/paper directory after running the makefile* 
## Motivation

The demand for healthier food consumption has increased significantly in recent years. Recent literature has investigated how the healthiness of online grocery purchases differs from offline (in-store) purchases (Chintala et al, 2024; Harris-Lagoudakis, 2022; Huyghe et al, 2017).
While online grocerybaskets tend to be healthier compared to offline baskets, it is unclear if the adoption of OGS contributes to
healthier consumption or if it results in a redistribution across channels, where consumers simply shift the
more healthy purchases online and purchase unhealthy products mainly offline. 

The central question in this project follows:

*How does the transition to hybrid grocery shopping affect the healthiness of food purchases across both online and offline grocery channels?*

## Method & Results

This study uses real world panel purchase data of households across a set of supermarket retailers. The dataset contains purchase data of 150 unique households in the Netherlands in 2019. These households made over 180.000 individual product purchases across 26 different retailers. 
The table below provides an overview of the relevant variables in the dataset. To answer the research question, I employ a Difference-in-Difference (DiD) approach proposed by Sant'Anna & Callaway (2021). This method allows for dealing with staggered adoption and is employed to analyse the changes in the healthiness of weekly grocery purchases for households that transition to
hybrid shopping against those that continue shopping exclusively offline. The healthiness of grocery purchases is measured as the proportion of expenditure that is spent on the healthy food categories fruits and vegetables.

The results of this study are presented in three main parts: (i) an overall effect, represented as a weighted average across each cohort; (ii) an individual cohort analysis to examine differences across adoption weeks and households; and (iii) a time-window analysis that investigates changes in patterns within an 8-week period before and after adoption. 
However, the analysis revealed no statistically significant findings, which limits my ability to draw conclusions regarding changes in the healthiness of grocery purchases after adopting online shopping channels.
